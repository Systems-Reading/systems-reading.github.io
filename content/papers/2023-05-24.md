**Abstract:**

Far memory systems allow an application to transparently access local memory as
well as memory belonging to remote machines. Fault tolerance is a critical
property of any practical approach for far memory, since machine failures (both
planned and unplanned) are endemic in datacenters. However, designing a fault
tolerance scheme that is efficient with respect to both computation and storage
is difficult. In this paper, we introduce Carbink, a far memory system that
uses erasure-coding, remote memory compaction, one-sided RMAs, and offloadable
parity calculations to achieve fast, storage-efficient fault tolerance.
Compared to Hydra, a state-of-the-art fault-tolerant system for far memory,
Carbink has 29% lower tail latency and 48% higher application performance, with
at most 35% higher memory usage.
