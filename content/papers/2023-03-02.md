**Abstract:**

Cloud applications are increasingly distributing data across multiple regions
and cloud providers. Unfortunately, widearea bulk data transfers are often
slow, bottlenecking applications. We demonstrate that it is possible to
significantly improve inter-region cloud bulk transfer throughput by adapting
network overlays to the cloud setting—that is, by routing data through indirect
paths at the application layer. However, directly applying network overlays in
this setting can result in unacceptable increases in cloud egress prices. We
present Skyplane, a system for bulk data transfer between cloud object stores
that uses cloud-aware network overlays to optimally navigate the trade-off
between price and performance. Skyplane's planner uses mixed-integer linear
programming to determine the optimal overlay path and resource allocation for
data transfer, subject to user-provided constraints on price or performance.
Skyplane outperforms public cloud transfer services by up to 4.6× for transfers
within one cloud and by up to 5.0× across clouds.
