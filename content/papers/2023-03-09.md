**Abstract:**

With the emergence of microsecond-scale NVMe storage devices, the Linux kernel
storage stack overhead has become significant, almost doubling access times. We
present XRP, a framework that allows applications to execute user-defined
storage functions, such as index lookups or aggregations, from an eBPF hook in
the NVMe driver, safely bypassing most of the kernelâ€™s storage stack. To
preserve file system semantics, XRP propagates a small amount of kernel state
to its NVMe driver hook where the user-registered eBPF functions are called. We
show how two key-value stores, BPF-KV, a simple B+-tree key-value store, and
WiredTiger, a popular log-structured merge tree storage engine, can leverage
XRP to significantly improve throughput and latency.
