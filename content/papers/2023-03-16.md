**Abstract:**

We offer a new metric for big data platforms, COST, or the Configuration that
Outperforms a Single Thread. The COST of a given platform for a given problem
is the hardware configuration required before the platform out- performs a
competent single-threaded implementation. COST weighs a systemâ€™s scalability
against the over- heads introduced by the system, and indicates the actual
performance gains of the system, without rewarding sys- tems that bring
substantial but parallelizable overheads. We survey measurements of
data-parallel systems re- cently reported in SOSP and OSDI, and find that many
systems have either a surprisingly large COST, often hundreds of cores, or
simply underperform one thread for all of their reported configurations.
