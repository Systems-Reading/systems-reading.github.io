# About

We read and discuss all sorts of systems papers, including computer networking,
operating systems, programming languages, hardware, and systems for machine
learning.  Everyone is welcome to select/present papers they find interesting.
If you're interested in attending or presenting, [sign up for our mailing
list](https://mailman.stanford.edu/mailman/listinfo/systems_reading)!

We meet weekly through the school year, excluding university holidays.  In Fall
2023, we're meeting on Fridays from 11 AM-12 PM in Gates 392.
